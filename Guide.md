# 🌍 Charity Donation Tracker

## 📌 Overview

**Charity Donation Tracker** is a blockchain-based platform designed to bring **complete transparency** to charitable donations. Powered by Cairo smart contracts and integrated with IPFS, the platform enables **donors to track exactly how their funds are used**, while ensuring **milestone-based disbursement**, **community governance**, and **auditable impact**.

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

> **"Every token accounted for."**

- **Charities** create verifiable campaigns with clear milestones.
- **Donors** fund campaigns and monitor usage.
- **Funds** are only released when milestones are achieved.
- **All transactions** and updates are publicly accessible.

---

## 👥 User Flow

1. ✅ **Charity Registration & Verification**
2. 📢 **Campaign Creation** with goals and milestones
3. 💸 **Donor Contributions** with optional messages
4. 📥 **Withdrawal Requests** by charity for each milestone
5. ✅ **Milestone Completion** with proof (IPFS upload)
6. 🔎 **Donor Impact & Audit Trail**

## 🧱 Smart Contract Structure (Cairo)

### 🏢 Charity

```cairo
struct Charity {
    address: ContractAddress,
    name: String,
    verified: bool,
    total_received: u256,
    reputation_score: u256,
}
```

### 🎯 Campaign

```cairo
struct Campaign {
    id: u256,
    charity: ContractAddress,
    title: String,
    description: String,
    target_amount: u256,
    current_amount: u256,
    deadline: u64,
    is_active: bool,
    milestones: Array<Milestone>,
}
```

### 💰 Donation

```cairo
struct Donation {
    donor: ContractAddress,
    campaign_id: u256,
    amount: u256,
    timestamp: u64,
    message: String,
}
```

### ⛳ Milestone

```cairo
struct Milestone {
    description: String,
    amount: u256,
    completed: bool,
    evidence_hash: felt252, // IPFS hash
}
```

## 🔍 Sample Milestone Lifecycle

```plaintext
1. Charity creates Campaign A with 3 milestones
2. Donors contribute 500 tokens
3. Charity completes Milestone 1
4. Uploads receipt to IPFS, submits hash
5. Community votes to approve
6. Smart contract releases 100 tokens
7. Repeat for next milestone...
```
